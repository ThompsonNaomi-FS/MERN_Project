# WDV229 Project
### Naomi Thompson / Student ID: 0005007393 
 Hello, my name is Naomi. I am a student at Full Sail University living in Nebraska. The purpose of this repository is to practice development using version control, and using a MERN tech stack while practicing the skills I have learned thus far. This work will help me to build a portfolio of skills and accomplishment that can be shared in the future. 
 
I live in a small village with my husband, 2 dogs, and 4 cats. I enjoy video games, anime, reading, writing, playing piano, singing, drawing, and painting my nails. I would love to learn martial arts and sword fighting some day. In addition to pursuing my Bachelor's degree, I work at a Jimmy John's as an opening manager. I am also a published author and intend to fully code my own website. Until then, I am learning WordPress. Feel free to visit my website [nschmitt.com](https://www.nschmitt.com/).
